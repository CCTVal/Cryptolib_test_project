As for now, this basically calls a Test_cryptolib function to send encrypted data and other test_cryptolib_decrypt function to receive encrypted data.
Which data to send and to check which to receive is being done in the lazyest and hardcoded way possible.

**To do**

Check if the Cryptolib decrypt function is being used as intended.

**Warning**

Editing the .ioc erases the "middleware" folder.
